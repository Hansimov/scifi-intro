Dialogue: 0,0:00:00.08,0:00:03.11,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Science fiction begins with Frankenstein.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:03.11,0:00:05.91,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,So many of the ideas, and the tropes,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:05.91,0:00:08.25,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,even the philosophy behind science fiction,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:08.27,0:00:10.65,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,come from this one great work.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:10.70,0:00:12.52,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,So let us start where we must,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:12.52,0:00:14.08,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,and talk Frankenstein.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:14.14,0:00:20.60,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,( Music )
Dialogue: 0,0:00:20.62,0:00:24.34,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,The very first sentence of the preface to Frankenstein reads thus,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:24.48,0:00:26.87,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,{\i1}"The event on which this fiction is founded,{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:26.92,0:00:28.96,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,{\i1}"has been supposed, by Dr. Darwin,{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:28.99,0:00:31.46,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,{\i1}"and some of the physiological writers of Germany,{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:31.51,0:00:33.87,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,{\i1}"as not of impossible occurrence.{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:33.96,0:00:36.97,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,{\i1}"I shall not be supposed as according the remotest degree of{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:36.97,0:00:39.12,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,{\i1\b0}"serious faith to such an imagination,{\i0\b1}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:39.12,0:00:42.60,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,{\i1}"yet, in assuming it as the basis of a work of fancy,{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.60,0:00:47.76,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,{\i1}I have not considered myself as merely weaving a series of supernatural terrors."{\i0}
Dialogue: 0,0:00:47.82,0:00:49.52,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,And it is on that statement
Dialogue: 0,0:00:49.52,0:00:52.09,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,that all of science fiction is founded.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:52.17,0:00:55.83,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Shelley is saying that the events in this book could be real,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:55.83,0:00:58.92,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,not that they are real or even that they are remotely likely,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:58.92,0:01:01.90,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,but they could exist in the universe we know.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:01.95,0:01:05.40,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Eventually, we will escape the bounds of this statement with science fiction,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:05.40,0:01:06.79,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,but it's this idea,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:06.79,0:01:11.40,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,the idea that our sci-fi tales exist within our rational world,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.40,0:01:14.52,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,within the bounds of what science tells us is possible,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:14.52,0:01:18.68,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,that makes science fiction fundamentally different from fantasy or myth.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:18.87,0:01:22.56,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,And that thought is incredibly important at the birth of the genre.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.56,0:01:26.33,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,This is what separates it out as its own distinct literary branch
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.33,0:01:28.66,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,and allows it to have rules and conventions 
Dialogue: 0,0:01:28.66,0:01:31.87,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,unlike those already existing genres of the fantastic,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.92,0:01:34.46,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,of horror or folklore or myth.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:34.55,0:01:37.79,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,It's also initially part of what gets us to buy in.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:37.86,0:01:42.17,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Science fiction uses the possible as a lens for our world.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:42.26,0:01:44.83,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,It may be the remote and the unlikely,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:44.83,0:01:47.68,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,but what better way to look at human nature
Dialogue: 0,0:01:47.68,0:01:52.90,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,than to set it against the extreme cases of what it might someday encounter
Dialogue: 0,0:01:52.90,0:01:54.59,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,and see what rolls out.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:54.67,0:01:56.62,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,This is so important to Shelley
Dialogue: 0,0:01:56.62,0:01:59.64,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,that it's the very first thing that's presented to the reader.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.64,0:02:02.92,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Without this idea of the fantastic possible,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.92,0:02:05.28,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,I don't think we have science fiction.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:05.36,0:02:09.48,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,But that is far from the only standard Frankenstein created for sci-fi.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:09.55,0:02:13.51,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Today, we are going to explore all the other ways that Frankenstein established.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:13.51,0:02:18.27,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Tropes, styles, and techniques that we almost take for granted in sci-fi today.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:18.42,0:02:21.53,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Now, before I tread any further, I should say one thing,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:21.60,0:02:24.23,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,if you only know this story from the movies,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.23,0:02:26.83,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,you don't actually know this story at all.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:26.91,0:02:28.92,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,The films have little to do with the book,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:28.92,0:02:32.08,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,and while it is actually a really worthwhile exercise
Dialogue: 0,0:02:32.08,0:02:35.79,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,to think about why this story has been interpreted and reimagined the way
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.80,0:02:37.68,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,it has throughout the 20th century.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.68,0:02:41.18,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Everything I talk about today will be regarding the original work.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:41.31,0:02:44.30,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,So let's start at the beginning, with a young man,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:44.35,0:02:48.41,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,obsessed by alchemy and yet fascinated by the power of science.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:48.47,0:02:51.42,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,A young man determined to overcome death
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.49,0:02:53.18,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,for the fame it might bring him.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:53.25,0:02:57.58,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,A young man blind to the consequences of what he is trying to do.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:57.72,0:02:59.98,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Let's talk about Victor Frankenstein.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:59.98,0:03:03.77,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Victor is the blueprint for the frustrated scientist trope.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:03.85,0:03:05.56,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,All of those other scientists
Dialogue: 0,0:03:05.58,0:03:10.52,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,you read about in comics, see in movies, or find in the pages of later science fiction,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:10.60,0:03:12.96,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,those who would have been so great for the world
Dialogue: 0,0:03:12.97,0:03:15.56,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,if the world had only acknowledged their genius,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:15.56,0:03:18.81,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,They are all basically riffs on Victor Frankenstein.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:18.81,0:03:23.07,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,In fact, this has become so common and so ingrained into pop culture
Dialogue: 0,0:03:23.07,0:03:26.96,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,that a lot of these characters pop up without their authors even really thinking about
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.96,0:03:29.63,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,the legacy of Victor Frankenstein that they come from.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:29.79,0:03:32.99,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Victor is also our model of scientific hubris.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:33.05,0:03:35.76,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,He believes that he can best death itself
Dialogue: 0,0:03:35.76,0:03:38.40,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,by creating life out of the parts of the dead,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:38.50,0:03:41.53,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,and thinking his own intellect to be so superior,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:41.53,0:03:46.71,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,he doesn't even once consider the ramifications of what he's doing until it's too late.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:46.84,0:03:51.77,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,He is the model for all of those characters punished for defying the laws of nature,
Dialogue: 0,0:03:51.79,0:03:54.92,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,for the scientist so obsessed with pursuing their ideas
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.92,0:03:59.43,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,that they don't even consider what those ideas might ultimately mean for humanity.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:59.52,0:04:01.32,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,But he's also a coward.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:01.32,0:04:03.75,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,At the first sight of his own creation,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:03.75,0:04:06.20,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,he flees because it's physically deformed,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:06.20,0:04:08.28,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,because it's too ugly to look at
Dialogue: 0,0:04:08.40,0:04:10.01,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,just the way he made it, 
Dialogue: 0,0:04:10.11,0:04:12.47,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,which brings us to the monster itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:12.53,0:04:16.79,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,An innocent, filled with gentle kindness and a love for the world,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:16.86,0:04:20.17,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,who is rejected at every turn for his physical appearance,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:20.17,0:04:22.81,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,eventually growing callus and cold.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:22.87,0:04:25.96,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,How many times in science fiction have we seen
Dialogue: 0,0:04:25.96,0:04:27.92,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,this monster with the heart of gold?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:27.92,0:04:30.87,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,I present to you that trope's origins,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:30.93,0:04:33.21,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,and like many things in Frankenstein
Dialogue: 0,0:04:33.25,0:04:38.17,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Shelley explores this trope far more thoroughly than many who would eventually borrow it.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:38.26,0:04:40.33,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,The monster, outwardly ugly,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:40.33,0:04:44.89,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,finds itself continuously rejected by an inwardly ugly humanity,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:44.95,0:04:46.98,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,rejected at birth by Victor,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:46.98,0:04:49.28,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,attacked in the first village he visited,
Dialogue: 0,0:04:49.28,0:04:52.01,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,turned away by the cottagers he cared for
Dialogue: 0,0:04:52.08,0:04:55.93,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,and thus, at last, the monster turns on humanity itself.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:56.05,0:04:57.87,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,This theme of rejection
Dialogue: 0,0:04:57.87,0:05:02.27,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,despite offering the best intentions and offering something truly of worth,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:02.30,0:05:05.20,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,has become not only a theme of science fiction literature
Dialogue: 0,0:05:05.20,0:05:07.89,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,but of the geek culture that has grown up around it.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:08.10,0:05:10.97,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,But part of the reason that we see nobility in the monster
Dialogue: 0,0:05:10.97,0:05:15.07,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,is that we see it self-educate, reading the greatest books of the past.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:15.21,0:05:19.91,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Mary Shelley saw her work as part of an ongoing tradition of Western literature.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.99,0:05:23.65,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Paradise Lost, Dante, The Sorrows of Young Werther,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:23.72,0:05:26.28,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,these are all directly referenced in the work.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:26.28,0:05:28.11,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,They serve as a foundation,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.11,0:05:31.10,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,as key insights into the character of the Monster,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:31.10,0:05:33.82,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,and they are things that the writer expects the reader
Dialogue: 0,0:05:33.83,0:05:36.41,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,to at least have a passing familiarity with.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:36.51,0:05:38.70,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,That's something that would became part of the genre, too.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:38.70,0:05:42.17,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Works like Hyperion are firmly grounded in that tradition,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:42.17,0:05:45.49,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,borrowing structure from Canterbury Tales and The Decameron,
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.49,0:05:47.70,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,even taking it's name from a Keats poem.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:47.79,0:05:49.96,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Even pieces as odd as Dhalgren
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.96,0:05:53.36,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,rely on the mythological and literary tradition of the west.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.45,0:05:55.96,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,There is an expectation in science fiction
Dialogue: 0,0:05:55.96,0:05:57.96,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,that the reader is well read.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.96,0:05:59.86,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,But there's an on-going debate
Dialogue: 0,0:05:59.86,0:06:04.17,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,as to whether sci-fi itself is part of the classic tradition or something new,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.26,0:06:08.21,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,and as great works of science fiction pour in from all over the globe,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:08.21,0:06:09.69,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,bringing in new traditions,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.72,0:06:12.09,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,that question becomes even more complex.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.15,0:06:15.05,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,But I should also mention how this tale is told,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:15.05,0:06:19.42,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,through letters, relating a story told to a young man named Robert
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.42,0:06:23.31,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,by the strange and wild scientist he finds out upon the ice.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:23.39,0:06:27.44,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Frankenstein is actually a story within a story within a book.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.44,0:06:31.67,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,The whole work is actually an epistolary novel, although that's easy to forget.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:31.67,0:06:33.90,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,And this allows us a juxtaposition.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.95,0:06:38.49,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Simply by having the young Robert's story set side by side with Victor's,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:38.49,0:06:42.98,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,as a reader, we are forced to consider the eager young explorer's ideals
Dialogue: 0,0:06:43.02,0:06:45.70,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,and, far more importantly, his motivations.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:45.70,0:06:48.25,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,We are forced to contrast them with Victor's
Dialogue: 0,0:06:48.30,0:06:50.49,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,just by using this framing device,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:50.49,0:06:53.34,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,Mary Shelley forces us as readers to think about

Dialogue: 0,0:06:55.76,0:06:59.24,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,And, while we rarely see this particular framing device again,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:59.24,0:07:02.16,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,it's important because it kicks off a long tradition
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.16,0:07:04.93,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,of science fiction using framing devices,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.93,0:07:07.40,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,especially for the purpose of making us question
Dialogue: 0,0:07:07.40,0:07:10.73,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,just how reliable the central narrator really is.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:10.77,0:07:12.73,英文 - Extra Sci Fi,,0,0,0,,And finally we have the title,
